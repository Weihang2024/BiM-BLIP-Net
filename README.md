# BiM-BLIP: Brain-inspired Multimodal BLIP for Scene Understanding Using EEG Data

## Overview
**BiM-BLIP (Brain-inspired Multimodal BLIP)** is a novel approach to enhancing scene understanding in educational settings by integrating EEG (electroencephalography) signals with visual data. This model combines Vision Transformers (ViTs) for visual data processing and brain-inspired neural networks to capture real-time neural responses. The BiM-BLIP model outperforms traditional single-modal methods, offering improved accuracy and robustness in complex, dynamic educational environments.

This repository contains the code and related resources for the development of BiM-BLIP, including model architecture, data preprocessing, and experimental setups.

## Key Features
- **Multimodal Approach**: Integrates EEG signals and visual data to enhance scene understanding.
- **Vision Transformers (ViTs)**: Utilizes ViTs for efficient extraction of spatial and temporal features from visual data.
- **Real-time Processing**: Models real-time EEG data to understand learners' psychological states and responses.
- **Educational Technology**: Focuses on applications in dynamic educational environments to create smarter learning technologies.
